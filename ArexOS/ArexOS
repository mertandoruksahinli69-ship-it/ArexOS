# ArexOS – Informational Guide

**ArexOS** is a minimal, modular, and educational operating system simulation designed to bring a Linux-like experience to Windows.  
Developed primarily for learning and experimentation, ArexOS runs on Windows and features a kernel written in C with support for Python, Java, and EXE drivers.

## Core Features

- **Minimal Kernel:** Written in C, handling basic system operations.
- **Driver Support:** Python, Java, and EXE modules can be integrated.
- **File Management:** Python GUI application for browsing and managing files.
- **GUI Applications:** Notepad, File Explorer, and Webcam apps included.
- **Modular Structure:** Separate kernel, driver, and application files for easy extension.
- **Educational Focus:** Designed to teach system-level programming and modular OS architecture.
